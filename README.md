Flutter Family App

A summer project I used to try and get my kids interested in coding in a fun, interactive, fast-result way.

It is written for Android 10, in Dart, for Flutter.

There are some games, map with some points of interest, kids' home pages and links to their favorite songs on YouTube.

FYI- the code is messy, not commented nearly enough and could be reduced by a lot. However it was clear enough for my kids (and for me :-) )

Enjoy
